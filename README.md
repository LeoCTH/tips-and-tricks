# tips-and-tricks
I like to help people with weird tech issues, since when I was less experienced, I also bothered people with my dumb questions. Some spat out a short answer in an instant, some recoiled in anger, and some gave an entire presentation on one simple dumb mistake.

And unsurprisingly, I learned the most from the third kind, the most eloquent and kind-hearted of those "pros". 

Once I've become a semi-"pro" myself, I figured that people who are less skilled in a field deserves to be guided step-by-step, hand-in-hand, towards the correct direction, even if that means I would have to break down the "simple" logic and mechanisms, down to a smooth flow of knowledge that, while verbose, everyone can understand.

This is the collection of those attempts. The topics of these snippets range from the basics of the basics — like boolean logic, bitwise operations, and even basic coding conventions — to the most specific details about some framework many had problems with; this is a very varied stew, and don't expect any kind of consistency if you're reading them in alphabetical order.

But that's enough blabbering from me, onward to the big ToC™...
